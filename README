This repo contains a set of files which can be added to a laravel installation to use a mod_auth_pubtkt compatible
scheme for authentication. In addition to setting the pubtkt needed by apache, it also sets another ticket
which contains the full details of the logged in user.

This allows other SSO applications to access the full details of the end user without having access to the database

Please note that these files need to be installed on top of breeze with inertia. If you use breeze without inertia, you
will need to mess with the views. But the views here won't be what you want anyway.

You are also likely to want to customise the web routes and probably the user object to add in things you need.

But this should at least get things wired up to show you how to create your own guard and ServiceProvider
